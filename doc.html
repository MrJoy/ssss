    <h4>What is "Secret Sharing"?</h4>
    
    Citing from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>
    article about <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing">Secret
      Sharing</a>:
    <blockquote>
      <p>
	In <a
	  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptography</a>, a
	<b>secret sharing scheme</b> is a method for distributing a <a
	  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secrecy"><i>secret</i></a> amongst
	a group of participants, each of which is allocated a <i>share</i> of
	the secret. The secret can only be reconstructed when the shares are
	combined together; individual shares are of no use on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
	More formally, in a secret sharing scheme there is one <i>dealer</i>
	and <i>n</i> <i>players</i>. The dealer gives a secret to the players,
	but only when specific conditions are fulfilled. The dealer
	accomplishes this by giving each player a share in such a way that any
	group of <i>t</i> (for <i>threshold</i>) or more players can together
	reconstruct the secret but no group of less than <i>t</i> players
	can. Such a system is called a <i>(t,n)</i>-threshold scheme.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        A popular technique to implement threshold schemes uses <a
	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation">
	polynomial interpolation</a> ("Lagrange interpolation"). This
        method was invented by <a
   	href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shamir"> Adi Shamir</a> in
        1979. You can play around with a threshold scheme on the <a
        href="http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/demo.html">demo page</a>.
	</p>
    <p>
    Note that Shamir's scheme is provable secure, that means: in a
    <i>(t,n)</i> scheme one can prove that it makes no difference
    whether an attacker has <i>t-1</i> valid shares at his disposal or
    none at all; as long as he has less than
    <i>t</i> shares, there is no better option than guessing to find
    out the secret.
    </p>
      <h4>Where is "Secret Sharing" used?</h4> Some popular examples are:
      <ul>
      <li>
	Good passwords are hard to memorize. A clever user could use a
	secret sharing scheme to generate a set of shares for a given
	password and store one share in his address book, one in his
	bank deposit safe, leave one share with a friend, etc. If one day he
	forgets his password, he can reconstruct it easily. Of
	course, writing passwords directly into the address book would
	pose a security risk, as it could be stolen by an "enemy". If
	a secret sharing scheme is used, the attacker has to steal
	many shares from different places.
      </li>
      <li>
	"A dealer could send <i>t</i> shares, all of which are
	necessary to recover the original secret, to a single
	recipient, using <i>t</i> different channels. An attacker
	would have to intercept all <i>t</i> shares to recover the
	secret, a task which may be more difficult than intercepting a
	single message" (<a
	  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_sharing">Wikipedia</a>).
      </li>
      <li>
	The director of a bank could generate shares for the bank's
	vault unlocking code and hand them out to his employees. Even
	if the director is not available, the vault can be opened, but only,
	when a certain number of employees do it together. Here secret
	sharing schemes allow the employment of not fully trusted
	people.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>What is "ssss"? Where can I download "ssss"?</h4>
    <p>
      <b>ssss</b> is an implementation of Shamir's secret sharing
      scheme for UNIX systems, especially developed for linux
      machines. The code is licensed under the <a
      href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a>.
      <b>ssss</b> does both: the generation of shares for a known
      secret and the reconstruction of a secret using user provided
      shares.  The software was written in 2006 by B. Poettering, it
      links against the <a href="http://swox.com/gmp/">GNU libgmp</a>
      multiprecision library (version 4.1.4 works well) and requires
      the <tt>/dev/random</tt> entropy source. Please send bug reports
      to <b><tt>ssss AT point-at-infinity.org</tt></b>.
    </p>
    <p>There is a <a
    href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/ssss/">freshmeat page</a> for
    <b>ssss</b>. A <a
    href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/ssss">debian
    package</a> is also available. If you are the lucky owner of a
    debian system just run <tt>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get
    install ssss</tt> to install <b>ssss</b>. Someone even ported (an
    outdated version of) <b>ssss</b> to <a
    href="http://www.seidlitz.ca/ssss/">Windows</a> (but with a
    lightly too sloppy random number generation, in my opinion).

    </p>

    <h4>How is "ssss" used? Is there an online demonstration?</h4> 
    <p>The generation of shares given a
      known secret is shown first.  A (3,5)-threshold scheme is used, that is:
      5 shares are generated, the secret can be reconstructed by any
      subset of size 3.
    </p>
    <pre>
      % ssss-split -t 3 -n 5
      Generating shares using a (3,5) scheme with dynamic security level.
      Enter the secret, at most 128 ASCII characters: my secret root password
      Using a 184 bit security level.
      1-1c41ef496eccfbeba439714085df8437236298da8dd824
      2-fbc74a03a50e14ab406c225afb5f45c40ae11976d2b665
      3-fa1c3a9c6df8af0779c36de6c33f6e36e989d0e0b91309
      4-468de7d6eb36674c9cf008c8e8fc8c566537ad6301eb9e
      5-4756974923c0dce0a55f4774d09ca7a4865f64f56a4ee0
    </pre>
    These shares can be combined to recreate the secret:
    <pre>
      % ssss-combine -t 3
      Enter 3 shares separated by newlines:
      Share [1/3]: 3-fa1c3a9c6df8af0779c36de6c33f6e36e989d0e0b91309
      Share [2/3]: 5-4756974923c0dce0a55f4774d09ca7a4865f64f56a4ee0
      Share [3/3]: 2-fbc74a03a50e14ab406c225afb5f45c40ae11976d2b665
      Resulting secret: my secret root password
    </pre>
    You can try it out on the
    <a href="http://point-at-infinity.org/ssss/demo.html">demo page</a>.

    <p>
    If larger secrets are to be shared a hybrid technique has to be
    applied: encrypt the secret with a block cipher (using openssl,
    gpg, etc) and apply secret sharing to just the key. See the man
    page for more information about this topic.
